# collatzConjecture

The Collatz conjecture applies to positive integers and speculates that it is always possible to get "back to 1" if you follow these steps:

If n is 1, stop.
Otherwise, if n is even, repeat this process on n/2
Otherwise, if n is odd, repeat this process on 3n + 1

#### The code is implemented using the c programming language

#### I included the <cs50.h> library

#### It is a project I did for @cs50's introduction to computer science [Week 3] - Algorithm
